          <summary>What is Evident Technologies?</summary>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Evident Technologies builds forensic-grade evidence processing systems designed for legal professionals, oversight bodies, and institutions that require immutable records, deterministic analysis, and reproducible exports.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Who is the platform designed for?</summary>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Legal teams, law enforcement agencies, compliance departments, government auditors, and any professional or organization that needs court-defensible evidence workflows with full chain-of-custody documentation.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What makes Evident different from standard document management?</summary>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Standard document systems allow edits and deletions. Evident enforces immutability — originals cannot be modified, every action is logged in append-only audit trails, and all outputs are cryptographically verified against source material.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How is evidence integrity maintained?</summary>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Every piece of evidence is hashed using SHA-256 at the point of intake. All subsequent access, transformations, and exports are logged in immutable, append-only audit records. Processing is deterministic — the same inputs always produce the same outputs.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can original evidence be modified or deleted?</summary>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>No. Original evidence is stored as immutable. The system does not permit overwrites, edits, or deletions of source material. Derived outputs are always linked back to and verifiable against their originals.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is audit log data ever purged?</summary>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Audit logs are append-only and are never deleted or overwritten. This is required for chain-of-custody integrity and evidentiary admissibility.</p>

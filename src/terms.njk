      These Terms govern your access to and use of services provided by Evident Technologies,
      LLC ("Evident"). Evident does business as <strong>EVIDENT</strong>. Please read these
      Terms and our <a href="/docs/#privacy">Privacy Policy</a> carefully before using the
      service. This page gives a short, plain-language summary for convenience; the full
      contractual terms and disclaimers follow below.

        We help lawyers and individuals prepare evidence for review and court submission.
        We built EVIDENT to reduce the time spent wrestling with discovery so you can focus
        on advocacy. We provide tools, not legal advice — you remain responsible for how you
        use outputs in any proceeding.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-4 font-semibold">Offer, trials and billing</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Our paid plans include a 14-day free trial (no credit card required). Founding-member
        discounts and institutional pricing for public defenders and legal aid organizations
        are available; contact sales to confirm eligibility and terms.
